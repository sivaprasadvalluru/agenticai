# Fintech Application Use Cases

## Overview
This document outlines the various use cases, agent interactions, and subgraphs involved in our fintech application. The application combines portfolio management, market analysis, and financial education using a multi-agent system powered by LangGraph, with an LLM Supervisor orchestrating agent interactions.

1. **Financial Education Subgraph**
   - Knowledge retrieval from ChromaDB
   - Content synthesis
   - Personalized learning paths

2. **Portfolio Optimization Subgraph**
   - Parallel analysis of multiple sectors
   - Risk assessment
   - Rebalancing recommendations

3. **Market Research Subgraph**
   - Parallel data gathering
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Trend identification

### 4. LLM Supervisor
- Orchestrates agent interactions
- Determines optimal agent sequence
- Resolves agent conflicts
- Maintains conversation context
- Evaluates response quality

## Complex Use Cases

```

### 2. Investment Decision with Education

#### Scenario: User wants to make an informed investment decision
**Flow:**
1. User asks about specific investment
2. LLM Supervisor coordinates multiple agents

**Questions and Answers:**
```
Q: "Should I invest in healthcare AI companies, and what should I know before investing?"

Flow:
1. LLM Supervisor:
   - Recognizes need for education and market analysis
   - Initiates Financial Education Subgraph

2. Financial Education Subgraph:
   a. Knowledge Retrieval:
      - Queries ChromaDB for healthcare AI sector knowledge
      - Retrieves relevant investment guidelines
      - Gathers risk management information

   b. Content Synthesis:
      - Combines knowledge base information
      - Structures educational content
      - Provides context for market analysis

3. Market Analyst Agent:
   - Analyzes healthcare AI market trends
   - Identifies key players
   - Provides market outlook

4. Portfolio Manager Agent:
   - Assesses portfolio fit
   - Suggests allocation strategy
   - Provides risk assessment

5. LLM Supervisor:
   - Combines educational content with market analysis
   - Ensures balanced perspective
   - Delivers comprehensive response
```

### 3. Market Crisis Response

#### Scenario: User needs guidance during market volatility
**Flow:**
1. User asks about market situation
2. LLM Supervisor manages multiple agent inputs

**Questions and Answers:**
```
Q: "The tech sector is experiencing high volatility. How should I protect my portfolio and identify opportunities?"

Flow:
1. LLM Supervisor:
   - Recognizes urgency of situation
   - Prioritizes market analysis
   - Initiates Market Research Subgraph

2. Market Research Subgraph:
   a. Parallel Analysis:
      - Market Conditions Branch:
         * Analyzes current market conditions
         * Identifies volatility drivers
         * Provides short-term outlook
      - Portfolio Impact Branch:
         * Assesses portfolio vulnerability
         * Suggests protective measures
         * Identifies potential opportunities
      - Knowledge Base Branch:
         * Retrieves crisis management strategies
         * Gathers historical context
         * Provides educational resources

   b. Results Synthesis:
      - Combines all parallel analyses
      - Prioritizes critical information
      - Generates actionable recommendations

3. LLM Supervisor:
   - Ensures balanced perspective
   - Delivers actionable response
```

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### 1. Sequential Processing (for Direct Agents)
```
User -> LLM Supervisor -> Agent1 -> Agent2 -> Agent3 -> LLM Supervisor -> User
```

### 2. Parallel Processing (for Subgraphs)
```
User -> LLM Supervisor
       -> Subgraph (Parallel Branches)
          -> Branch1
          -> Branch2
          -> Branch3
       -> LLM Supervisor (synthesis) -> User
```

### 3. Knowledge Base Integration
```
User Query -> LLM Supervisor
            -> Knowledge Base (ChromaDB)
               -> Content Retrieval
               -> Context Synthesis
            -> Agent/Subgraph Processing
            -> LLM Supervisor (synthesis) -> User
```
